# hello-world
Trying out git-hub
I am working on a double-entry accounting system for individuals, using Microsoft Access.
I have not found anything comparable in my searches.
I have used Access for many years, and I have written programs in Access.
However, I am not skilled in other languages, escpecillay not in Visual Basic.
I was a CPA and and a financial officer. I designed an accounting system for retail stores that was marketed by IBM.
Atlhough I do not have a lot of experience in other langurages, I have studied and/or used Basic (md-dos), Fortan, RPG, and Unix. 
I have used Quicken, QuickBooks, and gnuCash accounting programs for individuals, as well as PeachTree and other business accounting software.  
I feel my wide range of experience qualifies me to design the program I am talking about.  But I can use help with implementing it.
I aready have a basic design which is working.  
I need help with  things like pulling financial and investment data from other sites, and interfaces to Windows.
It is my intention to develop the program for Windows and for the US market only at this time.
Although I have not given a lot of thought to marketing it, I am thinking initially I would offer it as freeware, or for a nominal charge.
Requests for additional features would be evaluated and if feasible quoted on.
Supported versions might be made avaiable for a charge.
